# Udemy_PythonPractice
Hi there.
My name is Rina Kochirgan and I will not miss an opportunity to learn new things.
After finishing my computer science degree in the Technion, I wanted to practice and get more experienced with Python.
This repository is for educational purposes only.

The course is "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real-world Applications".<br>
I will try my best to incorporate new features in the applications.
